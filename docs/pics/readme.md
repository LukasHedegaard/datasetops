# Diagrams
Diagrams should be stored in a scalable format preferably SVG.
Its important that these images can be edited in the future by other developers.
As such the original "project files" used to create a diagram should also be stored here.

## [Drawio](https://www.draw.io/)
drawio provides the possiblity to embed project within the svg file itself.
This allows the files to be opened, edited and exported again. 
Please ensure to check this option when exporting a diagram such that it remains "editable".

The files created by drawio this way are:
